**Power Tracker - A side project that shows power grid consumption and grid emissions intensity in the UK.**

As part of the green transition of the power grid in the UK, many previous sources of power such as Coal & Gas generation have slowly been usurped by Wind energy. This process is actually far more advanced than most people realise. With Wind generation now accounting for the largest source of energy now and the carbon dioxide emissions of the grid falling precipitously as a result of this (and other things).

The idea of Power Tracker is to demonstrate this to people and allow them to make intelligent decisions about power consumption to further reduce their personal carbon dioxide emissions by proxy. 

Power tracker hooks into the UK National Grid services and fetches data detailing where power has been generated today (and is forecast to be generated) and creates a carbon dioxide emissions profile based on this. It uses the data to predict future emissions for the rest of the day. 
Testing is now completed and should soon be released to the app store under my new app store account.
