A mobile focussed software engineer with a background in Computer Science. I've always had a strong interest in computing and programming since childhood. Opting to study Computing and then Computer Science at the University of Nottingham before going into industry. 

I found that I had significant interest in the mobile software ecosystem in 2011/2012, developing software for iOS using the iPhone 3gs in Objective-C and writing apps for Android in Java during this time. I joined a mobile focussed development consultancy after university and continued in the ecosystem of mobile first from then on. I spent a few years learning my skill set around the world before becoming a senior iOS developer in 2018 and taking charge of projects as an individual or joining a larger team as a senior member. In 2024 I decided to focus on developing my own applications as an individual studio and to support other teams as a contractor. This change was in part to allow me to really concentrate on what I believe would provide value to individuals and companies.

In my free time away from my career I have a small family whom I love to spend time with. I have an interest in fitness with overall health, activity and longevity as a goal. This is achieved through a passion for middle distance Running, strength workouts and seasonal interests like Skiing. 

I am studying Vietnamese (hence the name Con Vá»‹t) and love to spend time in Vietnam and talking to Vietnamese people in their language.
